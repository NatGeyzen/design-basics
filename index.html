            <p>Developing a website is a complex process with many different aspects to it. A website shouldn't just have well written content, but it should also function properly and look good enough to attract the user's attention. That last part of the statement is all about good web design. There are many different components to creating a good design, but let's look at some of the basics to get you started.</p>

                <h3>Typography</h3>
                <p>No matter what kind of website you're building, it will always have a certain amount of content on there. This is where typography plays a big role. From choosing a font to use, to how to space your text, and how to make your text as readable as possible, here's what you need to know about typography in web design:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Choosing a font <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <span>Serif vs Sans Serif </span> <br>
                                <p>
                                    There are many types of fonts to choose from, but a lot of the more popular ones for web design will fall under either the "Serif" or "Sans Serif" categories. An example of the former is Times New Roman and serif fonts are recognizable because of the small lines attached to the end of the letters, giving them a more traditional and elegant feel. Sans serif fonts on the other hand, like Helvetica or Arial, don't have those little extra decorations and are usually considered to be more modern and minimalistic. Which one to choose, depends on the type of message you want your website to send. Serif fonts represent professionalism, trustworthiness, seriousness and history or experience. Sans serif fonts however, are considered to be more youthful, accesible and informal.     
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span>Standard browser fonts vs external fonts</span> 
                                <p>
                                    Every browser has built in fonts it can display, but what those are exactly can differ from browser to browser. However, there is also an option to use external fonts, such as Google fonts, by adding the desired font to the head of your HTML. This allows for a broader spectrum of fonts to be displayed on your website. Again, which of the two options you go with, depends on the type of project and how creative you want to get with it.    
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span>Choose one, max two fonts</span> 
                                <p>
                                    Fonts are a powerful tool in web design, but using too many different ones can quickly give the user a feeling of chaos. The golden rule here is to preferably choose one font, or two if you want seperate fonts for your headlines and your body text. Never use more than one font within your headlines or within your body text though.     
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>                        
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Making sure your text is readable
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <span>Headlines</span>
                                <p>
                                    Headlines, a.k.a titles, should always have a big(ger) font-size. Make sure that the size correlates with the type of h tag chosen in HTML. An h1 title should obviously be bigger than an h2 and so forth. To insure the best readibility, it is a good ide to decrease the font-weight of titles, making them less heavier-looking (less bold). 
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span>Body text</span>
                                <p>
                                    The main text on a website shouldn't have a font-size smaller than 15px or bigger than 25px roughly. Some fonts are naturally smaller of bigger, so experimenting a little is never a bad idea, but the 15-25px rule is generally considered to be a good guideline. 
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span>Line spacing</span>
                                <p>
                                    Without any line spacing added, each line will display immediately after the previous one, making text appear to be squished together. This makes it harder for the user to read your text, so use line spacing between 120% and 150% for better readability.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span>Characters per line</span>
                                <p>
                                    Limit the amount of characters per line to somewhere between 45 and 90 characters. Anything more and the user's eyes have to travel too much distance, anything less and text will appear to be very long in length, with hardly any width. There are exceptions to this rule, for example when text is displayed within a column. If this is not the case though stick to the rule. 
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

            <section class="Colors">
                <h3>Colors</h3>
                <p>Gone are the days of pure HTML pages where the background was white and the text was black. From images and icons to text, colors will be displayed on your website in many different ways. So here's some tips to ensure your project uses color in all the right ways:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li> 
                        <span>Choose one base color</span>
                        <p>
                            The base color will be the foundation of the color scheme used in a project, so it's pretty important. The color you pick, like almost any design decision made, depends on the message that you're trying to convey and the project itself. On top of that, there is a color theory that states that each color has a certain psychological effect on people. Red for example,is often associated with passion, but also violence and blood. Green and brown on the other hand, remind people of nature and being grounded. A lot of websites will have a certain base color because users unconciously link it to the core aspect of what they're trying to achieve. For a deeper dive into the color theory, check out the resourced at the bottom of the page.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        <span>Choose an accent color</span>
                        <p>
                            Accent colors are used in certain areas of web design to pop out from the other colors used. In most cases, this color is used for call to action buttons such as "buy now" or "sign up". Any element that you want the user's eye to be drawn to, use the accent color. Be careful not to use it too much though. It should be used in small amounts. A good choice for this color is the complimentary color to your base color, meaning both are on opposite ends of the color wheel.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        <span>Choose colors wisely</span>
                        <p>
                            There are many different ideas behind how many colors to use for any web design project. Some websites use two-tone colors and do it well, others use three or more colors that form a nice whole. If you want to use more than just your base and accent color, it's a good idea to use a color pallete picker tool. There are a ton of them out there, so go with one that you feel comfortable with. some will give you a color palette that contains over five colors, so be careful picking out which ones to use where. Like any other design tool, overusing color will make a user less likely to stay on your website.

            <section class="Images">
                <h3>Working with images</h3>
                <p>Images on websites nowadays are everywhere. Whether they are meant to illustrate a certain point, like some of the ones are here do,or they play a supporting role, images are pleasing to the eye and help break up the content of your page. Now there is one aspect of images that can be a little tricky, namely working with text directly on an image. Here are some methods to ensure that the text itself is readable and the combination of both looks good:</p>
    
                <ol>
                    <li> 
                        <span>Just put the text on the image</span>
                        <p>
                            The first, but not really easiest method is to place the text directly over the original image. The danger in this method is that if part of the image used has really bright or light colors, the text placed over it might be really hard to read. It is important that there is enough contrast between both to guarantee readability. So if you do choose this method, just make sure you - and other people (never hurts to ask a second opinion) - can actually clearly read the text.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        <span>Overlay the image</span>
                        <p>
                            The power of CSS allows web developers and designers to place an overlay, almost like a filter, over the image. Using a darker overlay will work best if your text is white, but it is also very possible to use a colored overlay if done right. Not only that, but a gradient overlay can be used, which will make the overlay gradually shift from one color to another, creating a nice effect. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        <span>Put your text in a box</span>
                        <p>
                            A third option is to put your text in a container and give the container a background color. In this case, it is a good idea to use an rgba value, which allows the box to appear semi-transparent. This lets the user still slightly see the image below the text box, while being able to read the text with little effort.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        <span>Blur the image</span>
                        <p>
                            Another very powerful effect is to blur the image somewhat. It draws the user's attention to the text at first instead of the image. Just make sure the image isn't blurred too hard, to where the user can't even recognize what the image is supposed to represent, as that defeats the purpose of using an image.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        <span>Use a floor fade</span>
                        <p>
                            This last one can only really be used if the text appears at the bottom of the page, but it is still a method worth mentioning. This effect creates a transition at the bottom of the image so it starts to slowly fade out. This means the colors will be darker towards the bottom of the image than they are in the overall image. This darker bottom fade will create a nice background for text to be placed on. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

            <section class="Icons">
                <h3>Working with icons</h3>
                <p>Icons are becoming an integral part of any website more and more. It makes sense given the fact that icons have been a part of daily life for a long time. From a stop sign to a bathroom sign, we all know what they mean, no text needed. That's exactly how icons on websites should be used too. So here are some fundamentals on how to use them correctly and make sure they dislay the best possible way:</p>
        
                    <ol>
                        <li> 
                            <span>Use icons to list features and steps</span>
                            <p>
                                A great reason to implement icons on any website is whenever multiple features or steps witin a process are the main content. The visualization will help users distinguish between all the different items within the list easier.  The icons also help in giving the user a quick overview of what exactly the website or certain content on the website is about.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                            <span>Use icons for actions and links</span>
                            <p>
                                A lot of social media websites uses icons to clarify the different components on their platform. Icons are also used in combination with certain actions that can be done. A good example of this is adding a picture to any social media platform, where users immediately know that a plus sign or a picture icon reference adding a new picture. 
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                            <span>Icons should be recognizable</span>
                            <p>
                                The most famous icon in web development is probably the menu icon. Everyone knows by now that the three little lines, also known as the hamburger menu, mean that a menu will appear when you click on it. This is a perfect example of recognizable icons. Any icon used should clearly represent what it is used for. If the icon and the element it accompanies don't line up, users will become confused. 
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                            <span>Label your icons</span>
                            <p>
                                When possible, add a label next to or close to the icon. Some icons don't need a label, because users have become accustomed to seeing them on the web. With other, less used icons though, users might not immediately know what the icon stands for. Clarifying it with simple text will help the user navigate the website better and easier.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                            <span>Icons should play a supporting role</span>
                            <p>
                                Don't overuse icons or place them center stage. Icons are not used in the same way as images are, but instead should be used wisely, supplementing the content on your website. The size of the icons should also reflect this mentality. Make them big enough that users can view them, but don't make them large enough where it disracts users from the content.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                            <span>Use icon fonts whenever possible</span>
                            <p>
                                There are are two main formats for icons: images and fonts. The fonts use vector images instead of normal images, which means they scale much better. Icon images, when enlarged, have a possibility of showing pixels, giving them a blurry appearance, while icons fonts don't have this issue. There are many icon fonts out there, ranging from free to ones you have to pay for.        
                            </p>

                    <h3>Spacing and lay-out</h3>
                    <p>White space is an important aspect of web design. If used correctly, it allows the user to get a fast and easy idea of the general flow of a web page. They can see what content belongs together, and what content is part of different sections. So here's a broad overview of how to use white space to create a better lay-out:</p>
            
                        <ol>
                            <li> 
                                <span>Put white space between elements, groups of elements and sections</span>
                                <p>
                                    White space insures that text doesn't appear too close to other content around it, making it easier to read. Any element should have some kind of white space around it, though the amount depends on its surrounding content. Any group of elements belonging together can have some white space in between to seperate each element, with more white space around the grouping itself. Different sections should also include enough white space so the user cam immediately see that the sections do not belong together.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li> 
                                <span>Use white space to define hierarchy </span>
                                <p>
                                    As mentioned in the previous tip, white space can give the user an immediate overview of which elements belong together, and which content is seperate from its surrounding content. When used right, a user should be able to distinguish between the different sections with just one overall look. Define the flow of your content, then use white space to build that flow.

                            </li>
                            <li> 
                                <span>Don't overexagerate</span>
                                <p>
                                    Using too much space between each of the different elements on a page, will interupt the flow of the document. It will also make it harder for a user to see the relationship between the different content on the page, so like any other design tool, make sure to use it wisely.

                        <h3>User experience (UX) </h3>
                        <p>When designing any kind of website, web application, or app, it's important to not just think about the content and the way the product looks, but how the user experiences it. Any kind of product can look good, but if it doesn't function properly,people won't buy it or they'll stop using it. The goal of any website is to attract users and keep them on the website, at least long enough to view the content and interact with the page.
                        </p>

                        <p>A good UX designer merges two different aspects of any website: the user's goal and the website's goal. In the case of this web page, it's easy because my goal is to teach about web design basics and I'm assuming if you're here, you're goal is to learn about them. In most cases though, both of those goals won't allign quite as well, so they have to blended into a nice combination that achieves both.
